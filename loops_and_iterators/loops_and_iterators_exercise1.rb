# What does the each method in the following program return after it is
# finished executing?

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,]
x.each do |a|
  a + 1
end

# Uh...I assume it returns what it is tasked with?
# Yeah, this makes sense.  I thought about punching this in irb, but thought that 
# might be "cheating" lol.  The solution video said that I could do this or even look
# at the Ruby doc for the Array#each method.
