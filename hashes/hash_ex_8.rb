# What is the reason for this error?
# NoMethodError: undefined method `keys' for Array

# Well, I would say that there isn't a method. XD Nah, that's part of it...
# hmm....undefined method....keys for array....
# I would say that there is a method that doesn't have the value 'keys' defined

#Oh, these are possible answers:

# A. We're missing keys in an array variable. Check

# B. There is no method called keys for Array objects.

# C. keys is an Array object, but it hasn't been defined yet.

# D. There's an array of strings, and we're trying to get the string keys out of the array, but it doesn't exist.

# I'm going to say A or C...and I'm entirely wrong.

# It's B.

# Hmm....it makes sense that there isn't a method called keys for Array objects.
# That's why RubyDoci is so important.
