# I think that this is going to print "Yippeee!!!!" to the screen.
# lol it's not going to print anything to the screen.  Hahahahaha.  I think
# that this is because there is no command for scream to be outputed...
# This reminds me that I should pay careful attention to detais in programming.
# I should have realized that this was a "trick" question.  I think I got ahead of
# myself and was already trying to solve a non-existent problem....
