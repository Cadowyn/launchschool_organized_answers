=begin ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
   from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
   from (irb):4
   from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

 I think that this is telling me that I need to finish something on line 4.
 It seems like 'calculate_project' needs an additional argument. 

 I got this right! :)
