# For the purposes of this section an exception can be viewed as synonymous with
# an error.  During the course of program excecution, many things can go wrong for
# a variety of reasons, and when something does go wrong, usually we say
# "an exception is raised".  This is a common technical phrase that just
# means my code encountered some sort of error condition.  WHen an exception
# is raised, it is usally accompanies by a large output of text of what looks like gibberish (lol).
# It's in this gibberish that I will find clues to help me figure out
# what the problem is.  I need to start developing an eye for scanning
# and parsing this gibberish output.  This is one of the most important 
# skills that I can develop over time, because if I'm like most programmers,
# my code will generate a lot of exceptions. 

# I'm going to do the exercises in irb now.
