=begin
  
What will the following code print to the screen?

def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  return
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")
=end

# It will output "Yippeee!!!!""

# actually, it will print nothing because it isn't being told to print to screen!

# Pay ATTENTION TO DETAILS WHEN CODING. PAY ATTENTION TO what the instructions
# say and what the CODE SAYS.
