# NoMethodError: undefined method `keys' for Array

=begin 

A. We're missing keys in an array variable.

B. There is no method called keys for Array objects.

C. keys is an Array object, but it hasn't been defined yet.

D. There's an array of strings, and we're trying to get 
 the string keys out of the array, but it doesn't exist.
 =end

 # To me it sounds like there isn't a method that is being defined. The
 # method is 'keys'. 

 So far I'm leaning towards B. A is out.  B is correct!
