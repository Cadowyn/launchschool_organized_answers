# Show an easier way to write this array:

flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles"]

# PEDAC

# Problem - This is probably an alternative code;
  # -  After relooking at the question, it says show an easier way to write this array...
  # not necessarily show an easier way to code

# Edge case...maybe a variety of ways?

# Data Structure

  # Had to check the answer 

  flinstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)

  # Found it in the docs
