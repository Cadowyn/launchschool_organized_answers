Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen. If we 
had a 40 character wide table of Flintstone family members, how could we easily center 
that title above the table with spaces?
=end

title = "Flintstones Family Members"

# I'm assuming it is going to be someything with center.

title.center(40) 

# Let's see.  I was right but for some reason I wasn't sure if it would be 20 (because of half)
# or 40.
