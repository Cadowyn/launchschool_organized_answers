# What is the value of a, b, and c in following program?

string = "Welcome to America!"
a = string[6]
b = string[11]
c = string[19]

# I think a will equal e because that is the 6th spot...?
# I think b will equal A because that is the 11th spot...?
# I think c will equal nil....? (hahahaha I was right. ;) )
