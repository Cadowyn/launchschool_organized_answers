# What is the return value of the following statement? Why?

['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size

# the pop is gonna remove 'caterpillar' and the return value
# will be ['ant', 'bear']

# lemme see what size will cause to happen; size is an alias for
# length; I think it would output the amount of 2

# Let's see what the answer is

# Totally read this wrong.  The pop removed caterpillar and made that
# item to be returned.  The size counted the characters in the word
# caterpillar

# So it will output
# => 11

# lol I was so off
