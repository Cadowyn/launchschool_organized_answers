=begin

a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

  

- given an array of integers,
- set a starting point
- go through each item in the array
    -skip one element and move to the next element   
-when done with the length of the array
output every other element of the array




START

# Given a collection of integers called "numbers"
SET iterator = 1
SET saved_number - value within numbers collection at space 1

WHILE iterator <= length of numbers
  SET current)number = value withiin numbers collection at space "iterator"
  IF 




saved_number = iterator + 1


PRINT saved_mnumber
